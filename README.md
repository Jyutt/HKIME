# HKIME

HKIME is an on-going project that aims to create an Input Method Editor for Cantonese.
Progress is documented in the Jupyter Notebooks located under the directory `notebooks`.

Our latest milestone is a simple bi-gram based statistical language model with
no smoothing from a corpus made from scraping Cantonese Wikipedia. We are currently
working on training a NN-based language model.

Relevant papers and sources that have tremendously aided our progress are in
`resources.md` and `sources.md`.

### Core Components of the Project
All of these are in progress at the moment
- Fuzzy Jyutping / Processing different romanizations
- Jyutping Segmentation
- Jyut2Char: Jyutping to Character Conversion
- Scraping / Corpus Generation
- Neural Net Language Model
